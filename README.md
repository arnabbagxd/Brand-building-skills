# Brand Building Skills for AI Agents

A collection of AI agent skills focused on brand building services. Built for brand strategists, agency owners, and founders who want AI coding agents to help with brand strategy, naming, identity, voice, positioning, messaging, and launch. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a brand task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `brand-context` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand the brand, audience, and positioning before doing anything.

## Getting Started

### Install with Claude Code

Add these skills to your Claude Code project by pointing to this repository in your project settings, or copy the skills directory into your project.

### Use with any Agent Skills-compatible tool

Skills install to `.agents/skills/` following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).

### Start with brand-context

Before running any other brand skill, run `brand-context` to set up the foundation:

```
Set brand context for [Brand Name] — [what it does], targeting [audience]
```

This creates `.agents/brand-context.md` that all other skills read automatically.

### Example workflows

**Starting a new brand from scratch:**
1. `brand-context` — capture brand basics
2. `target-audience` — define the ICP
3. `competitor-branding` — map the landscape
4. `brand-positioning` — find the position
5. `brand-strategy` — full strategy report
6. `brand-naming` — name the brand
7. `brand-identity` — visual identity brief
8. `brand-voice` — verbal identity
9. `brand-messaging` — messaging framework
10. `brand-guidelines` — document everything
11. `brand-launch` — plan the launch

**Auditing an existing brand:**
1. `brand-context` — document current state
2. `brand-audit` — diagnose what's working and what isn't
3. `rebranding` — if significant change is needed

**Agency client work:**
1. `brand-strategy` — presents questionnaire, generates full report
2. `brand-naming` — evaluates or generates name options
3. `brand-identity` — briefs the design team
4. `brand-guidelines` — final deliverable to the client
